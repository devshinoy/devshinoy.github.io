A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/hrtzt/pen/YPoeWd.

 A simple pure CSS switch in just 45 lines of code, anything else is just for the cute background animation and positioning.

I also discovered that switching this is like a therapy when you're bored at the office, so come back anytime you're boring.
